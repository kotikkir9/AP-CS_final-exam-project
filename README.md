This repo contains a part of my Academy Profession (AP) Degree in Computer Science final exam project.

The project was developed in collaboration with the company Freightsolution, where my goal was to improve a part of thier existing platform called _Statistics_.

In this repo, I only included the code that was developed by myself during my final exam, which is only a small part of a the whole platform codebase.
